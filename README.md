<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Building the project

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/LauraDiosan-CS/lab8-11-polimorfism-VladCuciureanu.git && cd lab8-11-polimorfism-VladCuciureanu
```
2. Create 'build' directory and enter it
```sh
mkdir build && cd build
```
3. Generate makefiles using cmake
```sh
cmake ..
```
4. Compile binary using make
```sh
make
```

### What's next?

If everything went well, by now, inside 'build' there should be multiple folders.

In order to run the app, cd into 'build/src' and run the following command:
```sh
./pharmacy
```

In order to run the test routine, cd into 'build/tests' and run the following command:
```sh
./run_tests
```
